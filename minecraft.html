    Hey everyone we live!

    <br>
    <br>
    We officially have a server running at my place. It should be on at all times.
    Has barely been tested so probably will have bugs.
    Oh, yeah, <b>there is an allowlist</b>! This means that not just anyone
    can connect. You must be on the <i>cool list</i>. This is to prevent people
    from fucking up my shit. In the game I don't really care. I mean my computer,
    and server, and forwarding, and specific/complicated electronic networking shit.
    I don't expect this to be a problem though. It's only there as an extra precaution 
    and cause we are playing it by ear. I just want to see how it works. If enough
    people don't like this or it is a reasonably significant barrier to having
    friends actually play together then I will fix this.<br>
    Anyway, to be added to the <i>cool list</i> you must send me your Xbox Live username! That's all! 
    If you have played on @demonv1337's server before then I have already added you
    cause you're cool and I don't hate you that much probably. 
    <br><br>
    To contact me you can use the social media links at the bottom of the page,
    or just tell me at work, or text me, email me at 'goddoesnotwearabuttplug@austinmiller.net', 
    or send an actual letter to me in the mail, or shoot fireworks into the air in morse code or something.<br>
    The best way is to text me, the second best is whatever way you talk to me the most (snap/insta/etc), 
    the third best is anything else.
    <br><br>
    If you cannot connect then one of the following three things are probably occurring:<br>
    1. You are not on the allowlist, and you should get in touch with me to have you added.
    (<i>this is your fault</i>)<br><br>
    2. There is some sort of error in the IP address, ports, or internet connection
    between you and this server. You should ask me or @demonv1337 for help.<br>
    (<i>this is also your fault</i>)<br><br>
    3. The server is down for maintenance (saving, adjusting settings, et cetera)
    and it will be back up shortly. <br><br>
    (<i>def not my fault; probs still your fault somehow</i>)
    <hr>
    <br><br>
    Here's the con deets:<br><br>
    1/2. Open minecraft and log in and stuff.
    1.  Go to "<i>Server</i>", not "<i>Friends</i>" like we were doing before.<br><br>
    2.  The <b>server name</b> is "<i>nipsded</i>". I do not know if this is important yet.
    You can try to name it whatever you want..i think it'll probs work anyway.<br><br>
    3.  The <b>server address</b> is "<i>minecraft.austinmiller.net</i>". Notice that it's different from the
    page you're on right now!<br><br>
    4.  The <b>port</b> should be filled in for you already. It should say
    "<i>19132</i>". If it says a different number then change it. If it doesn't say 
    anything at all then type it in. If it says 19133 then something weird is happening
    and I literally have no idea why but it might work anyway...who knows the internet is weird.<br><br>
    5.  Now press Save! After saving the server details, it should take you back to the list of featured servers
    (which is stupid) but if you scroll down you should see "nipsded" (or whatever server name you gave it)
    and you can join..godspeed.
