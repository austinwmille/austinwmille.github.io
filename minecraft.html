    Hey everyone we live!

    <br>
    <br>
    Welcome to the page. After a bit of back and forth, I've decided to leave the minecraft server open to anyone.
    Below are some brief details about the server followed by connection instructions. Thanks for visiting.
    <br><br>
    This server is intended mostly for friends and family. It's a vanilla server with no cheats or mods rn. 
    It's just something that's there if you ever want to play with
    someone and need an easy way to do that. To that end, this is a <i>mostly</i> kid friendly server. Don't be ugly; respect others.
    <br><br>

    If you are having trouble connecting or need help with computer stuff or Minecraft stuff in general then feel free to
    reach out to me. If you know @demonv1337 irl he can help you out as well. 
    You can contact me using the social media links at the bottom of the page, or text me, or whatever way is easiest for you.
    <br><br>
    May death come swiftly for us all,<br>

    <big>Here's what you need to do:</big> <small>(use the checkboxes to mark your progress)</small>
    <ol>
        <li><input type="checkbox"/> Open minecraft and log in and stuff. </li><br><br>
        <li><input type="checkbox"/> Go to the "<i>Server</i>" tab, not "<i>Friends</i>" like we were doing before. </li><br><br>
        <li><input type="checkbox"/> Scroll down, past the 'featured' servers, and press <b>add server</b>. 
            <ul>
                <br>
                <li>If you cannot see that button then you are probably
                    using a console like a Switch or Xbox. You can still connect by changing your internet settings, and don't
                    worry it's not very hard.
                </li>
                <br id="goback">
                <li>There are additional instructions for you <button><a href="#switch" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit;">below</a></button>. Hit me up with any questions!</li>
            </ul>
        </li><br><br>
        <li><input type="checkbox"/> The <b>server name</b> is "<i>nipsded</i>". I do not know if this is important yet.
            You can try to name it whatever you want..i think it'll probs work and anyways.</li><br><br>
        <li><input type="checkbox"/> The <b>server address</b> is "<i>minecraft.austinmiller.net</i>". Notice that it's different from the
            page you're on right now! 
            <ul>
                <li>It might just say <b>address</b>, or <b>IP address</b>, or something else. They are all the same thing!

                </li>
            </ul>
        </li><br><br>
        <li><input type="checkbox"/> The <b>port</b> should be filled in for you already. It should say
            "<i>19132</i>". If it says a different number then change it. If it doesn't say 
            anything at all then type it in. </li><br><br>
        <li><input type="checkbox"/> Now press <b>Save</b>! After saving the server details, it should take you back to the list of featured servers
                (which is stupid) but if you scroll down you should see "nipsded" (or whatever server name you gave it)
                and it should now be saved for whenever you want to join. Godspeed 
        </li><br><br>
    </ol>

    <p>
        <big>Are you playing on a Switch? Is the add server button not there?</big> <br>
        <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
        <small>
you will have to change the internet settings for your Switch or Xbox. If you're using something else and the <b>add server</b> button is missing then you should def message me first cause idk what's happening to you</small>
        </pre>
            <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
            <small>
    Follow the instructions in this video to play on Switch (and Xbox but you might have questions so just message me or @Demon)</small>

        <br>
            <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
                <small>
Since I can't connect to the server from my own wifi (and don't have an Xbox), I have not tested this yet!</small>
        </pre>
        <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
            <small>
BUT please don't worry, doing this is very safe (much safer than me hosting a public server at my house). Here's what's happening:</small>
            <small>
You CANNOT choose the IP address of the server you want to join. This is <b>DUMB</b> and Nintendo and Microsoft should fix this. Digressing, they still show you and let you join 'featured servers', right? You know all of those servers it shows you? Changing your DNS settings like the video changes what happens when you join those servers! It changes their 'address'.

After following the video, go back to the <i>Server</i> tab. All of the 'featured servers' will still be there. BUT when you press '<i>Join Server</i>' it will take you to a new page that has new buttons! 

Now, finally, you can choose '<i>add server</i>' and it will let you <button><a href="#switch" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit;">pick</a></button> the <b>server address</b> which "<i>minecraft.austinmiller.net</i>", and the <b>port</b> which should still be the same "<i>19132</i>".
            </small>
        </pre>

    <p> Here are some known problems atm:
        <ul>
            <li><s>You cannot play on a Switch! This is Nintendo's fault and idk a workaround rn, sorry</s><br>
            UPDATE, see the previous section (literally right above this) for a workaround if using Switch or Xbox! :)</li><br>
            <li><s>I can't figure out how to show coordinates, so if you get lost you're on your own.</s></li><br>
            <li>People attached to my home wifi CANNOT connect (fam take note) unless using a Playstation lol</li>
                <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
It will work if you connect to a hotspot instead of our router.
                </pre>
        </ul>
