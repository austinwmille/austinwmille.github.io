    Hey everyone we live!

    <br>
    <br>
    Welcome to the page. After a bit of back and forth, I've decided to leave the minecraft server open to anyone.
    Below are some brief details about the server followed by connection instructions. Thanks for visiting.
    <br><br>
    This server is intended mostly for friends and family. It's just something that's there if you ever want to play with
    someone and need an easy way to do that. 
    If you are having trouble connecting or need help with computer stuff or Minecraft stuff in general then feel free to
    reach out to me. If you know @demonv1337 irl he can help you out as well.
    You can contact me using the social media links at the bottom of the page, or text, me or whatever way is easiest for you.

    Here's the con deets:<br><br>
    1/2. Open minecraft and log in and stuff.<br><br>
    1.  Go to "<i>Server</i>", not "<i>Friends</i>" like we were doing before.<br><br>
    2.  The <b>server name</b> is "<i>nipsded</i>". I do not know if this is important yet.
    You can try to name it whatever you want..i think it'll probs work anyway.<br><br>
    3.  The <b>server address</b> is "<i>minecraft.austinmiller.net</i>". Notice that it's different from the
    page you're on right now!<br><br>
    4.  The <b>port</b> should be filled in for you already. It should say
    "<i>19132</i>". If it says a different number then change it. If it doesn't say 
    anything at all then type it in.<br><br>
    5.  Now press Save! After saving the server details, it should take you back to the list of featured servers
    (which is stupid) but if you scroll down you should see "nipsded" (or whatever server name you gave it)
    and it should now be saved for whenever you want to join. Godspeed 
    <br><br>
