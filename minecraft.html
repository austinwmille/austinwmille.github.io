    Hey everyone we live!

    <br>
    <br>
    We officially have a server running at my place. Has barely been tested so probably will have bugs.
    Hit me up if there's any trouble connecting. Oh, yeah, there is no whitelist! This means anyone that has the below
    information can connect at any time. In order to prevent randos a little bit (just in case, not expected),
    the first time you join you may not be able to do anything. You're considered a 'visitor' but idk what that means.
    Im gonna try to put the regulars on a list, but for others (or friends) just tell them to connect. Once connected,
    I can promote them to member.

    <br><br>
    Here's the deets:<br><br>
    1.  Go to "<i>Server</i>", not "<i>Friends</i>" like we were doing before.<br><br>
    2.  The <b>server name</b> is "<i>nipsded</i>". I do not know if this is important yet.
    You can try to name it whatever you want..i think it'll probs work anyway.<br><br>
    3.  The <b>server address</b> is "<i>minecraft.austinmiller.net</i>". Notice that it's different from the
    page you're on right now!<br><br>
    4.  The <b>port</b> should be filled in for you already. It should say
    "<i>19132</i>". If it says a different number then change it. If it doesn't say 
    anything at all then type it in.<br><br>
    5.  Now press Save! It should take you back to the list of featured servers
    which is stupid but if you scroll down you should see "nips420" (or whatever server name you gave it)
    and you can join..godspeed.
