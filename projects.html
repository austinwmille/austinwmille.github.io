        <h4><b>Current interests include 1. making this website look like it was written by someone who 
            knows what they're doing, and 2. getting more money. Incidentally, I'm also taking online classes
            in Data Science with Python, Blockchain Technology, and Aeronautical Engineering. I've been 
            accepted for graduate study at John's Hopkins for Applied Physics OR Space Systems Engineering.
            Still undecided, but I'm hoping to start in Jan 2022 as long as goal number 2. (above) is met.
